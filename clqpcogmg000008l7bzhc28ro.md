As we bid farewell to 2023, I look back and can hardly believe what I've accomplished!

This year, I've grown significantly in my experience and confidence as a security automation engineer. I've developed a passion for running (which I never thought I'd say) and reading. I ran both a 5k and 10k while weighing 250 lbs. As we enter 2024, I want to maintain this momentum and continue moving closer to the dream life and person I aspire to be.

A couple of weeks ago, I was speaking with my best friend Cristian, who runs [Urroz Designs](https://www.urroz.ca/), about 2024. We were both determined to make 2024 our best year ever, not just in our careers but also in our health and passions. He shared his Project 365 with me, outlining some of his big, audacious goals. This inspired me to set some ambitious goals for myself this year as well. I find that sharing goals publicly helps me stay committed to them. Putting things out into the world also seems to have a self-fulfilling prophecy effect. So, without further ado, here are the goals on my Project 365 for the year of 2024!
