When setting up my environment I like to use the same colors or themes for everything.

Dracula Theme is by far my favorite and I love the pro theme they offer. If you are looking to set up your own Dracula Theme or Icons you may want the HEX codes. Here is the list of all Colors in the Dracula official themes:

| **Palette** | **HEX** |
| --- | --- |
| Background | #282a36 |
| Current Line | #44475a |
| Foreground | #f8f8f2 |
| Comment | #6272a4 |
| Cyan | #8be9fd |
| Green | #50fa7b |
| Orange | #ffb86c |
| Pink | #ff79c6 |
| Purple | #bd93f9 |
| Red | #ff5555 |
| Yellow | #f1fa8c |

For more details about how to apply these different colors to represent different code symbols, please see the [Dracula Specification](https://spec.draculatheme.com/).
